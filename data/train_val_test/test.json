In his interview, Altman was emphatic that OpenAI needs both regulators and society to be as involved as possible with the rollout of ChatGPT -- insisting that feedback will help deter the potential negative consequences the technology could have on humanity. He added that he is in \"regular contact\" with government officials. ChatGPT is an AI language model, the GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. Released only a few months ago, it is already considered the fastest-growing consumer application in history. The app hit 100 million monthly active users in just a few months. In comparison, TikTok took nine months to reach that many users and Instagram took nearly three years, according to a UBS study. Watch the exclusive interview with Sam Altman on \"World News Tonight with David Muir\" at 6:30 p.m. ET on ABC. Though \"not perfect,\" per Altman, GPT-4 scored in the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam. It also scored a near-perfect score on the SAT Math test, and it can now proficiently write computer code in most programming languages. GPT-4 is just one step toward OpenAI's goal to eventually build Artificial General Intelligence, which is when AI crosses a powerful threshold which could be described as AI systems that are generally smarter than humans.",

It also casts light on the profiteering methods of the drug industry's price mediators -- the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) -- at a time when Congress has shifted its focus to them. Insulin has come to embody the perversity of the U.S. healthcare system as list prices for the century-old drug, which 8.4 million Americans depend on for survival, quintupled over two decades to more than $300 for a single vial. Just because Lilly -- which sells about a third of the insulin in the U.S. -- lowers its price doesn't mean all patients will pay less, even in the long run. Lilly capped the out-of-pocket costs of its most popular insulins at $35 effective immediately, and said that later this year the list price of its \"authorized generic\" Lispro -- which is identical to Humalog, its bestselling brand-name insulin -- would fall to $25 a vial. This followed President Joe Biden's State of the Union address, and speeches since, in which he has blamed \"Big Pharma\" and its \"record profits\" for the incredible expense of insulin. David Ricks, Lilly CEO, in interviews March 1 called for other manufacturers to join his company in \"taking away the affordability challenges\" of diabetes. Even as Lilly promotes its altruism, this move may actually save it money, said healthcare analyst Sean Dickson, JD, MPH. A federal rule taking effect next year penalizes companies that charge Medicaid high prices, especially for older, branded drugs. Lowering the list price of Humalog would allow Lilly to pay significantly less in rebates to government Medicaid programs that buy the drug. Drugmakers have long ceased to be the only, or even primary, villain of the insulin price scandal. The three companies that produce nearly all the insulin in this country -- Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk -- posted stagnant or declining revenue from their versions of the drug in recent years despite the steadily climbing list prices they charged. They've even advised investors that they don't see insulin sales as a high-profit area anymore. But while Lilly is cutting the \"wholesale acquisition price,\" or list price, of its big-selling insulin drugs, \"will other 'parties at play' cause this price to increase before it hits my pharmacy counter?\" asked Rebecca Kelly of Richmond, Kentucky, who has type 1 diabetes and is an activist for lower drug prices.
