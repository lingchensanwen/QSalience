# QSalience

## :star2: Introduction
QSalience introduces the first application-agnostic salience predictor for inquisitive questions. This project is fine-tuned over our newly annotated dataset of 1,766 (context, question) pairs with salience scores. We explore the usefulness of question salience in downstream applications such as TL;DR expansion.
