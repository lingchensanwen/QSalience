The White House scoffs at the idea that the big aircraft deal signals a significant change in the status of the administration's relations with Riyadh after Biden's fierce criticism early in his presidency of the Saudis' human rights record and of the Saudi-led OPEC+ oil cartel move to cut production last year. \"We're looking forward here in trying to make sure that this strategic partnership really does in every possible way support our national security interests there in the region and around the world,\" White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. He spoke after Boeing announced this week the Saudis would purchase up to 121 aircraft. But China's involvement in facilitating a resumption of Iran-Saudi diplomatic ties and the major Boeing contract -- one the White House said it advocated for -- have added a new twist to Biden's roller-coaster relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. As a candidate for the White House, Biden vowed that Saudi rulers would pay a \"price\" under his watch for the 2018 killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom's leadership. More recently, after the OPEC+ oil cartel announced in October it was cutting production, Biden promised \"consequences\" for a move that the administration said was helping Russia.

            "article": "Silver has long been known for its ability to kill some of the nasty microbes that can make people sick. In hospitals, it\u2019s used to help burn victims, to combat germs on catheters and even to wipe out dangerous \u201csuperbugs\u201d that have grown resistant to traditional antibiotics. Now, capitalizing on consumers\u2019 fear of germs, companies are adding tiny, powerful silver particles to cutting boards, underwear, yoga mats, running shirts, socks and an expanding array of other \u201cantibacterial\u201d goods. Such products are made possible by recent advances in technology that allow manufacturers to create nano-sized silver and incorporate it into various materials. (A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter; a human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide.) But some scientists and environmental watchdog groups say putting nanosilver to widespread use may pose risks, as no one knows how chronic exposure to the particles may affect human health or the ecosystem in the long run. They also worry that silver may lose its power to fight infections if bacteria become more resistant, a phenomenon already seen with other antibiotic drugs and with triclosan, an ingredient added to antibacterial soaps, cosmetics and other commercial goods. \u201cSome humans are quite frightened of bacteria, and the tendency to overuse silver is likely,\u201d said Samuel Luoma, an emeritus researcher with the U.S. Geological Survey and the author of \u201cSilver Nanotechnologies and the Environment,\u201d a report published by the Pew Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies. \u201cWhat concerns me is the explosion of products which we don\u2019t know are effective and that are not necessary,\u201d Luoma said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to prove it\u2019s worth taking the risk before we put it in the environment.\u201d  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began requiring manufacturers of nanosilver to register their products, saying the particles could pose different risks than conventional silver. But critics, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, say the agency\u2019s process is flawed because it allows the products to be sold commercially several years before safety studies are completed. Consumers, meanwhile, often can\u2019t tell whether products contain nano-sized silver because nanomaterials aren\u2019t required to be labeled. \u201cThe presence of nanotechnology in consumer products has gone underground,\u201d said Emma Fauss, who in 2008 compiled an inventory of commercial nanotechnology products for the Pew project. \u201cManufacturers shy away from labeling things in their products unless it\u2019s trendy. There\u2019s a perception that if it\u2019s labeled, it could be dangerous.\u201d  Silver kills germs when it oxidizes and releases silver ions, which are lethal to bacteria and yeast. Ancient civilizations used the metal to treat open wounds, and American pioneers tossed silver coins into water storage barrels to keep water fresh.",
